## 📋 About the Project

This project is a practical study of **RPA (Robotic Process Automation)** and **Web Scraping**.

The goal was to develop a "bot" capable of navigating complex dynamic websites (flight booking platforms), extracting real-time data, and presenting it on an interactive Dashboard for decision-making.

**Technical Highlight:** The system demonstrates how to integrate a Backend Script (Selenium) with a Frontend Interface (Streamlit), using CSV files as an intermediate database.

## 🚀 Features

* **Automated Search:** Autonomous navigation and scanning of multiple consecutive dates.
* **Data Processing:** Data Cleaning and currency conversion.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Visual representation of price fluctuations.
* **IATA Codes:** Support for international airport codes (e.g., JFK, LHR, GRU).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python:** Core logic.
* **Selenium WebDriver:** Browser automation and DOM interaction.
* **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis (Dataframes).
* **Streamlit:** Web interface and data visualization.

## 📦 How to Run

1.  Clone the repository:

    git clone [https://github.com/icarodev10/flight-sniper.git](https://github.com/icarodev10/flight-sniper.git)
    

2.  Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


3.  Run the Dashboard:

    streamlit run dashboard.py

    The system will open in your default browser. Configure your trip in the sidebar and click "Start Auto Search".
